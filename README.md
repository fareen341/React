React js VS React Native?


<b>React Native.</b> React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework used for developing a mobile application for iOS Android, and Windows. 
It uses only JavaScript to build a cross-platform mobile app. React Native is same as React, but it uses native components instead of using web components as building blocks.

<b>React JS</b> - often simply referred to as just “React” - is a JavaScript library designed for developing the view layer for mobile and web-based applications.
