React js VS React Native?


React Native. React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework used for developing a mobile application for iOS Android, and Windows. 
It uses only JavaScript to build a cross-platform mobile app. React Native is same as React, but it uses native components instead of using web components as building blocks.

React JS - often simply referred to as just “React” - is a JavaScript library designed for developing the view layer for mobile and web-based applications.
